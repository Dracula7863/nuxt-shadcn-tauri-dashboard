## 🎯 1-Minute Elevator Pitch

**"Hi, I'm Othmane Bakkes, and I built a modern desktop dashboard application that challenges the status quo of bloated desktop apps.**

**The Problem:** Traditional desktop applications built with Electron are heavy - often 100MB+ in size, consuming hundreds of megabytes of RAM, and taking seconds to start up. This is because they bundle an entire Chromium browser with each app.

**My Solution:** I used Tauri, a Rust-based framework that uses the system's native webview instead of bundling a browser. The result? My dashboard app is under 10MB - that's **10 times smaller** than typical Electron apps.

**The Stack:** I combined Tauri with Nuxt 4 (modern Vue.js framework), shadcn-vue (beautiful component library), and TypeScript for a production-ready application.

**Features:** The dashboard includes system information display, persistent storage, file system operations, notifications, and window management - all with native OS integration.

**Impact:** This demonstrates that we can build fast, lightweight, secure desktop applications without sacrificing developer experience or user interface quality."

### Slide 5: Tech Stack

**Modern, Production-Ready Technologies**

**Frontend:**

- **Nuxt 4** - Vue.js framework with auto-imports, SSG
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX
- **shadcn-vue** - Beautiful, accessible components
- **UnoCSS** - Instant atomic CSS engine

**Backend:**

- **Rust** - Fast, safe systems language
- **Tauri 2** - Latest desktop framework
- **Plugins** - OS, File System, Storage, Notifications

**DevOps:**

- **pnpm** - Fast package manager
- **Vite** - Lightning-fast builds
- **ESLint** - Code quality

### Slide 6: Key Features

**What Can It Do?**

1. **System Information** 📊
   - Display OS platform, architecture, version
   - Real-time system data

2. **Persistent Storage** 💾
   - Key-value store with CRUD operations
   - JSON-based, automatic persistence

3. **File System** 📁
   - Read/write text files
   - Native file picker dialogs
   - Support for .txt, .md, .json, .js, .ts, .vue

4. **Notifications** 🔔
   - System notifications with permission flow
   - Custom templates (Info, Success, Warning, Error)

5. **Window Management** 🖼️
   - Fullscreen toggle in header
   - Maximize, minimize, center controls
   - State tracking

### Slide 7: Security Model

**Security by Design**

**Tauri's Permission System:**

```json
{
  "permissions": [
    "core:window:allow-set-fullscreen",
    "fs:allow-read-text-file",
    "store:allow-get"
  ]
}
```

**Why This Matters:**

- ✅ Explicit allowlist - only granted APIs work
- ✅ No Node.js in renderer - limited attack surface
- ✅ Rust backend - memory safe
- ✅ System webview - always updated by OS
- ✅ Fine-grained control - per-API method permissions

**vs Electron:**

- ❌ Full Node.js access by default
- ❌ Bundled Chromium may have vulnerabilities
- ❌ Implicit permissions

### Slide 8: Code Quality

**Clean, Maintainable, Documented**

**Best Practices:**

- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ Component-based architecture
- ✅ Composition API patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation
- ✅ GitHub templates (issues, PRs)
- ✅ Contributing guidelines
- ✅ MIT License

**Developer Experience:**

- Auto-imports (components, composables)
- File-based routing
- Hot module replacement
- TypeScript IntelliSense
- ESLint integration

### Slide 9: Performance Benchmarks

**Real Numbers**

**Bundle Size:**

- Before (Electron equivalent): ~120 MB
- After (Tauri): ~8 MB
- **Savings: 93%**

**Memory Usage (Idle):**

- Electron: ~180 MB
- This App: ~65 MB
- **Savings: 64%**

**Startup Time:**

- Electron: ~4 seconds
- This App: ~1.5 seconds
- **Improvement: 62%**

### Slide 10: Technical Challenges Solved

**What I Learned**

**Challenge 1: Component Conflicts**

- Problem: 40+ duplicate component warnings
- Solution: Configure auto-imports to exclude index.ts files

**Challenge 2: Tauri v2 API Changes**

- Problem: Breaking changes from v1
- Solution: Use load() for Store, setFullscreen() instead of toggleFullscreen()

**Challenge 3: Web + Desktop Compatibility**

- Problem: Tauri APIs break in browser mode
- Solution: Dynamic imports with runtime detection

**Challenge 4: Font Loading Timeouts**

- Problem: UnoCSS trying to fetch Google Fonts
- Solution: System font stack for offline use

## 🗣️ Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Why not just use Electron?**
A: Electron is great for rapid prototyping, but Tauri offers significantly better performance with bundle sizes 10x smaller, faster startup times, and lower memory usage. For production apps where performance matters, Tauri is the better choice.

**Q: Is Tauri production-ready?**
A: Yes! Tauri 2.0 is stable and used in production by many companies. It has a strong security model, active development, and comprehensive documentation.

**Q: Do I need to learn Rust?**
A: Not necessarily. You can build full-featured apps using only JavaScript/TypeScript and Tauri's plugins. Rust is only needed for custom native functionality beyond what plugins provide.

**Q: Can it access native APIs?**
A: Yes! Through Tauri's plugin system and custom Rust commands, you can access any OS API - file system, notifications, system info, clipboard, etc.

**Q: How do you handle updates?**
A: Tauri has a built-in updater that supports delta updates (only download changes, not the entire app). This makes updates much faster than Electron.

**Q: What about backward compatibility?**
A: The app uses the system's webview, so it's as compatible as the user's OS. Modern versions of Windows, macOS, and Linux all have excellent webview support.

**Q: Performance in real-world use?**
A: The app starts in ~1.5 seconds, uses ~65MB RAM idle, and responds instantly to user input. It feels native because it uses native OS components.

**Q: Can I use npm packages?**
A: Yes! Any frontend npm package works. Backend logic is Rust, but you interact with it through simple JavaScript APIs.

**Q: Mobile support?**
A: Tauri is desktop-focused. For mobile, you'd use Capacitor or Tauri Mobile (in alpha).

**Q: Why shadcn-vue instead of other UI libraries?**
A: shadcn-vue components are copy-paste (not npm installed), built on Radix Vue primitives for accessibility, fully customizable, and follow modern design patterns.

## 💬 Interview Talking Points

### Technical Deep Dive

"The most interesting technical challenge was adapting to Tauri v2's security model. Unlike v1, many constructors are private - for example, Store must be loaded via load() function, not new Store(). This forced me to think carefully about API design and async patterns."

### Problem-Solving

"When I encountered component duplicate warnings, I debugged by examining how Nuxt's component auto-import works. I discovered that index.ts files in shadcn-vue were being registered alongside .vue files. The solution was configuring extensions: ['vue'] to exclude TypeScript files."

### Architecture Decisions

"I chose SSR: false in Nuxt because Tauri requires static files for desktop bundling. This meant using nuxt generate to create a static site that Tauri's webview can load. It's a hybrid approach - SSG for production, CSR for development."

### Learning Experience

"This project taught me the intersection of web and native development. I learned Rust basics, Tauri's permission system, cross-platform considerations, and how to structure a hybrid web/desktop application."

### Future Vision

"I see desktop apps becoming more web-like while retaining native performance. Tauri represents this future - lightweight, secure, and developer-friendly. I plan to extend this project with system tray support, global shortcuts, and auto-updates."
